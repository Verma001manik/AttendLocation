# Introduction 

This project assumes that the user is under a sustained entity that needs to guard and maintain the attendance of everybody present in the entity. The project has been developed (under development) 
on a certain assumptions where there were physical devices present for marking of the user's attendance . The physical devices or machines as one would say are in the ratio of 1: 80 . 
Thats a very long time waiting time for each and everyone to mark their attendance. 
As this is still under development , we have just introduced a basic idea for marking of a user's attendance based on their current location . As  there are lot of flaws that need to be 
understood and carefully select , we still vision the project to have its own digital -in-display-sensors to check for the users fingerprints.
